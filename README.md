#Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains various car attributes that influence pricing. The notebook performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to build an accurate car price prediction model.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: Car Price Prediction Challenge. It contains detailed car information, such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine specifications, and price.

#Features and Analysis

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Model Training: Applying regression models, eg linear regression and random forest to predict car prices.
